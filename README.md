# Timers

A simple EXILED plugin that adds spawn timers below each spawn bar in the Spectator UI.

![Example](https://github.com/LumiFae/Timers/blob/master/imgs/snippet.png)

Dependencies:

[RueI](https://github.com/LolaLollipop/RueI) or [HintServiceMeow](https://github.com/MeowServer/HintServiceMeow)
EXILED (v9 required)

## Download

You can download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/LumiFae/Timers/releases/latest) page.

Decide which version of Timers you are using, if you are using RueI, then use Timers-RueI.dll. If you are using HintServiceMeow then use Timers-HSM.dll.

If you are using neither, I recommend RueI, but you will have to download the RueI.dll dependency from the repository, unless it's not there then you'll have to find it yourself.

Put the downloaded plugin file inside your EXILED/Plugins folder, and if using RueI, then put the RueI.dll inside EXILED/Plugins/dependencies.

Restart your server, change config values (if needed) and you're good to go!
