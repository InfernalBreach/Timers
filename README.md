# Timers ![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/LumiFae/Timers/total)

A simple EXILED plugin that adds spawn timers below each spawn bar in the Spectator UI.

![Example](https://github.com/LumiFae/Timers/blob/master/imgs/snippet.png)

Dependencies:

[RueI](https://github.com/LolaLollipop/RueI) or [HintServiceMeow](https://github.com/MeowServer/HintServiceMeow)

EXILED (v9 required)

### Timers is breaking on the 2nd round?

RueI may be the cause, it has issues with 2 very common plugins from what I've seen, in this case though you can use HSM, which doesn't go in the dependencies folder, but the plugins folder, you can download HSM from [here](https://github.com/MeowServer/HintServiceMeow/releases/latest).

## Download

You can download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/LumiFae/Timers/releases/latest) page.

Decide which version of Timers you are using, if you are using RueI, then use Timers-RueI.dll. If you are using
HintServiceMeow then use Timers-HSM.dll.

If you are using neither, I recommend RueI, if you don't already have RueI on your server installed, you can get it from [here](https://github.com/pawslee/RueI/releases/latest).

Put the downloaded plugin file inside your EXILED/Plugins folder, and if using RueI, then put the RueI.dll inside
EXILED/Plugins/dependencies.

Restart your server, change config values (if needed) and you're good to go!
